Using UR4 Landscapes

**Terragen or World Machine good for generating maps

#What's good about Landscapes

+ UR4 landscapes use 4 bytes per vertex vs static mesh using about 20-24 bytes per vertex (1/6th storage space)
+ Support LOD (Level Of Detail) and streaming == makes it easy for UR4 to determine what to show when at what resolution
+ Up to 8196x8196 heightmaps for import see ** (typical UR4 scale is one meter per unit) possible 8kmx8km size maps
+ Good built-in tools for sculpting
+ Works well with mini-maps
